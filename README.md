# Api-s-Requests
Please find below the description of the task I have done:

- The project consists of 4 APIs. i.e. GET, POST, PUT and DELETE
- The POST API allows you to create a mobile screen dummy data which takes the following params: title, description, categorytitle, categories, product.
- The GET API allows you to get the specific data that takes the id params.
- The PUT API allows you to update existing dummy data.
- The DELETE API allows you to delete the existing data and also requires ID as params.
